Follow these steps for completing your project:

- [ ] Once you have your `node_modules` go ahead and run `yarn server` or `npm run server` to start your node server.
- [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's  Repo).
- [ ] Add your Project Manager as a Reviewer on the Pull-request
- [ ] PM then will count the HW as done by  merging the branch back into master.
